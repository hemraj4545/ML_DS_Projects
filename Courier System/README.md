# COURIER SERVICE SYSTEM

## THE PROJECT OVERVIEW

The assignment is to design and implement a web-based Courier Service System. There are 2 types of end users interacting to the system:

i. Managing Staff

ii. Delivery Staff

All the end users are required to login for authentication and authorisation purposes.

## OBJECTIVES

Develop the practical ability to describe, justify, and implement an object-oriented system.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

At the end of this coursework, you should be able to:

- Design and develop a software solution using object-oriented paradigm and translate it into software application that exploit the strength of object-oriented paradigm (C6, PLO2)
- Demonstrate object-oriented concepts and their functionalities in the existing system (A3, PLO4)


# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

a) The following functionalities should be provided for the managing staff&#39;s interface:

- To add, delete, search, and update all staff&#39;s information.
- To add, delete, search, and update all customers&#39; information.
- To create orders for customers.
- To collect payment and generate receipt.
- To assign available delivery staff to handle orders.
- To view all rating and feedback information.
- In addition, some reporting functionality is required such as the number of orders and the performances of the staff over a given time etc (managing staff would like to get as much useful information from the system as possible and is therefore open to the inclusion of any other useful reports).

b) The following functionalities should be provided for the delivery staff&#39;s interface:

- To edit individual profile.
- To view individual rating and feedback.
- To update the status of assigned delivery task by emailing the acknowledgement of receipt to customer.

You are also required to identify the relationship among the entities and also develop the necessary methods needed to fulfil the requirements of the expected systems.

# GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

- The program submitted should compile and be executed without errors
- Validation should be done for each entry from the users in order to avoid logical errors.
- The implementation code **must highlight** the use of object-oriented programming concepts as required by the solution.
- Students should use **text files** for storing and retrieving data required for the system.
- **Not allowed** to use any database tools like access / oracle etc.

# DEVELOPMENT TOOLS

The program written in Java language and you can use any Java development IDE as a tool but the back-end data store must be **.txt** files.
