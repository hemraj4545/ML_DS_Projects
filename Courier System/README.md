Object Oriented Development with Java (CT038-3-2) Page 6 of 6

**COURSEWORK TITLE**

COURIER SERVICE SYSTEM

1. **THE COURSEWORK OVERVIEW**

The assignment is to design and implement a web-based Courier Service System. There are 2 types of end users interacting to the system:

i. Managing Staff

ii. Delivery Staff

All the end users are required to login for authentication and authorisation purposes.

1. **OBJECTIVES**  **OF THIS COURSEWORK**

Develop the practical ability to describe, justify, and implement an object-oriented system.

1. **LEARNING OUTCOMES**

At the end of this coursework, you should be able to:

- Design and develop a software solution using object-oriented paradigm and translate it into software application that exploit the strength of object-oriented paradigm (C6, PLO2)
- Demonstrate object-oriented concepts and their functionalities in the existing system (A3, PLO4)

1. **TYPE**

Group Assignment (2 in a group); each member is expected to complete 50% of all functional requirements.

1. **COURSEWORK DESCRIPTION**

a) The following functionalities should be provided for the managing staff&#39;s interface:

- To add, delete, search, and update all staff&#39;s information.
- To add, delete, search, and update all customers&#39; information.
- To create orders for customers.
- To collect payment and generate receipt.
- To assign available delivery staff to handle orders.
- To view all rating and feedback information.
- In addition, some reporting functionality is required such as the number of orders and the performances of the staff over a given time etc (managing staff would like to get as much useful information from the system as possible and is therefore open to the inclusion of any other useful reports).

b) The following functionalities should be provided for the delivery staff&#39;s interface:

- To edit individual profile.
- To view individual rating and feedback.
- To update the status of assigned delivery task by emailing the acknowledgement of receipt to customer.

You are also required to identify the relationship among the entities and also develop the necessary methods needed to fulfil the requirements of the expected systems.

1. **GENERAL REQUIREMENTS**

- The program submitted should compile and be executed without errors
- Validation should be done for each entry from the users in order to avoid logical errors.
- The implementation code **must highlight** the use of object-oriented programming concepts as required by the solution.
- Students should use **text files** for storing and retrieving data required for the system.
- **Not allowed** to use any database tools like access / oracle etc.

1. **DELIVERABLES:**

- The system with complete code delivered in softcopy form by uploading to Moodle.
- Documents delivered in softcopy form by uploading to Moodle.
- Submission deadline: Friday, 27 November 2020, 11:59 pm

  1. **SYSTEM &amp; DOCUMENATION FORMAT**

- The completed application of the system as well as the softcopy of the report must be uploaded to Moodle.
- The application must contain all the relevant source code.

  1. **DOCUMENTS: COURSEWORK REPORT**

- As part of the assessment, you must submit the project report in softcopy form, which should have the following format:

1. _Cover Page:_

All reports must be prepared with a _front cover_. A protective transparent plastic sheet can be placed in front of the report to protect the front cover. The front cover should be presented with the following details:

- Module
- Coursework Title
- Intake
- Group member (Student name and ID)
- Date Assigned (the date the report was handed out).
- Date Completed (the date the report is due to be handed in).

1. _Contents:_

- Description and justification of the design and the implementation codes which illustrate the object oriented programming concepts incorporated into the solution
- A 2000-word report based on the object-oriented topic researched

1. _Conclusion_

1. _References_

- The font size used in the report must be 12pt and the font is Times New Roman. Full source code is not allowed to be included in the report. The report must be typed and clearly printed.
- You may source algorithms and information from the Internet or books. Proper referencing of the resources should be evident in the document.
- All references must be made using the Harvard Naming Convention as shown below:

_The theory was first propounded in 1970 (Larsen, A.E. 1971), but since then has been refuted; M.K. Larsen (1983) is among those most energetic in their opposition………._
